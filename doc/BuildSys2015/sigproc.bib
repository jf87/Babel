	Abstract = {Commercial buildings are attractive targets for introduc- ing innovative cyber-physical control systems, because they are already highly instrumented distributed systems which consume large quantities of energy. However, they are not currently programmable in a meaningful sense because each building is constructed with vertically inte- grated, closed subsystems and without uniform abstrac- tions to write applications against. We develop a set of operating system services called BOSS, which supports multiple portable, fault-tolerant applications on top of the distributed physical resources present in large commer- cial buildings. We evaluate our system based on lessons learned from deployments of many novel applications in our test building, a four-year-old, 140,000sf building with modern digital controls, as well as partial deploy- ments at other sites.},

@article{Krioukov2012,
	Abstract = {Many commercial buildings have digital controls and extensive sensor networks that can be used to develop novel applications for saving energy, detecting faults, improving comfort, etc. However, buildings are custom designed, leading to differences in functionality, connectivity, controls and operation. As a result today's building applications are hard to write and non-portable. What is required is a form of mass customization that allows applications to automatically adapt to differences in buildings. We present BAS, an application programming interface and runtime for portable building applications. BAS provides a fuzzy query interface allowing application authors to describe the building components they require in terms of functional and spatial relationships. The resulting queries implicitly handle multiple building designs. BAS also incorporates a hierarchical driver model, exposing common functions of building components through standard interfaces. We demonstrate and evaluate BAS by implementing two novel applications - an occupant HVAC control app and a ventilation optimization app - on two different buildings using raw building control protocols and then again using BAS. We show that the BAS code is much shorter, easier to understand and does not change for each building. {\copyright} 2012 ACM.},

	Abstract = {Thermal comfort has traditionally been measured solely by temperature. While other methods such as Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) are available for measuring thermal com- fort, the parameters required for an accurate value are overly complicated to obtain and require a great deal of sensory in- put. This paper proposes to bypass overly cumbersome or simplistic measures thermal comfort by bringing humans in the loop. By using humans as sensors, we can accurately adjust temperatures to improve occupant comfort. We show that occupants are more comfortable with a system that con- tinually adjusts to thermal preference than a system that at- tempts to predict user comfort based on environmental fac- tors. In addition, we also show that such a system is able to save 10.1\% energy while improving the quality of service.},

	Abstract = {In spite of its tremendous value, metadata is generally sparse and incomplete, thereby hampering the effectiveness of digital information services. Many of the existing mechanisms for the automated creation of metadata rely primarily on content analysis which can be costly and inefficient. The automatic metadata generation system proposed in this article leverages resource relationships generated from existing metadata as a medium for propagation from metadata-rich to metadata-poor resources. Because of its independence from content analysis, it can be applied to a wide variety of resource media types and is shown to be computationally inexpensive. The proposed method operates through two distinct phases. Occurrence and co-occurrence algorithms first generate an associative network of repository resources leveraging existing repository metadata. Second, using the associative network as a substrate, metadata associated with metadata-rich resources is propagated to metadata-poor resources by means of a discrete-form spreading activation algorithm. This article discusses the general framework for building associative networks, an algorithm for disseminating metadata through such networks, and the results of an experiment and validation of the proposed method using a standard bibliographic dataset.},

	Abstract = {Collaborative tagging describes the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keywords to shared content. Recently, collaborative tagging has grown in   popularity on the web, on sites that allow users to tag bookmarks, photographs and other content. In this paper we analyze the structure of collaborative tagging  systems as well as their dynamic aspects. Specifically, we discovered regularities in user activity, tag frequencies, kinds of tags used, bursts of popularity in  bookmarking and a remarkable stability in the relative proportions of tags within a given URL. We also present a dynamic model of collaborative tagging that predicts these stable patterns and relates them to imitation and shared knowledge.},

@article{Mathes2004,
	Abstract = {This paper examines user-generated metadata as implemented and applied in two web services designed to share and organize digital media to better understand grassroots classification. Metadata - data about data - allows systems to collocate related information, and helps users find relevant information. The creation of metadata has generally been approached in two ways: professional creation and author creation. In libraries and other organizations, creating metadata, primarily in the form of catalog records, has traditionally been the domain of dedicated professionals working with complex, detailed rule sets and vocabularies. The primary problem with this approach is scalability and its impracticality for the vast amounts of content being produced and used, especially on the World Wide Web. The apparatus and tools built around professional cataloging systems are generally too complicated for anyone without specialized training and knowledge. A second approach is for metadata to be created by authors. The movement towards creator described documents was heralded by SGML, theWWW, and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. There are problems with this approach as well - often due to inadequate or inaccurate description, or outright deception. This paper examines a third approach: user-created metadata, where users of the documents and media create metadata for their own individual use that is also shared throughout a community.},

@article{Yang2005,
	Abstract = {The semantic Web has emerged to replace the World Wide Web (WWW or the Web) as the unique platform for information sharing. Applications such as e-commerce will be and could be plausible only if we can annotate the Web pages with their semantics. For newly developed semantic Web resources, such annotation can be done manually or by help of some authoring tools. However, it is not practical to semantically annotating existing Web pages due to the gigantic amount of them. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a machine learning approach to automatically generate semantic metadata for Web pages. The proposed automated process adopts the self-organizing map algorithm to cluster training Web pages and conducts a text mining process to discover some semantic descriptions about the Web pages. Preliminary experiments show that our method may generate semantically relevant metadata for the Web pages},
