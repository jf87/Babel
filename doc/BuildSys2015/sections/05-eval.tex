\section{System Evaluation} % (fold)
\label{sec:system_evaluation}


\subsection{Experiment Setup}


which buildings we tried, what's the building profile.
how much data involved.



\subsection{Performance} % (fold)
\label{sub:performance}
Here we should say something about latency.
How long does it take to discover a match?
What is a typical latency of a real BMS?

% subsection performance (end)


\subsection{Accuracy} % (fold)
\label{sub:accuracy}
Here we describe how accurat our sytem works.
Do we get false positives?
We can make a curve, formula on the length of the pattern in comparison to the accuracy.

% subsection accuracy (end)


\subsection{Sample Applications} % (fold)
\label{sub:sample_applications}
We show that having a metadata labeling/matching for setpoints, it is possible to have applications that are transferable between buildings.
